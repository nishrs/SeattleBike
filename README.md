Cycling Trends in Seattle
-------------------------

**Note: this is a work-in-progress**

You can preview the notebook on nbviewer [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jakevdp/SeattleBike/blob/master/SeattleCycling.ipynb)

This is a quick exploration of cycling trends in Seattle, to figure out whether numbers are increasing year-on-year when accounting for things like weather, temperature, daylight, etc.

Bicycle counts come from the [Fremont Bike Counter](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k)

Temperature and precipitation information come from the [National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/res40.pl)
